# Task 1.3 Summary: Environment Setup for Amazon Bedrock Integration

## Completed Actions

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Verified boto3 is already installed and accessible
   - Added boto3 as an optional dependency in pyproject.toml under `[project.optional-dependencies]`
   - Added installation notes for Bedrock support: `pip install fast-agent-mcp[bedrock]`

2. **AWS Regions and Models**:
   - Created and executed a script to verify available Bedrock models across AWS regions
   - Confirmed Claude models (our initial target) are available in all major regions
   - Identified us-east-1 and us-west-2 as the regions with the most comprehensive model support

3. **Test Environment**:
   - Created a dedicated test directory at `/tests/bedrock/`
   - Set up test configuration in `fastagent.config.yaml`
   - Created a connection verification script in `test_bedrock_connection.py`
   - Created an agent test script in `test_agent.py` for integration testing

4. **Credentials and Authentication**:
   - Confirmed that existing credentials have the necessary permissions for Bedrock access
   - Identified required permissions: bedrock:InvokeModel, bedrock-runtime:InvokeModel, bedrock-runtime:Converse
   - Implemented configuration options for both direct API keys and credential chain

## Key Findings

1. **Model Availability**:
   - Claude 3 models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) are available across regions
   - Claude 3.5 and Claude 3.7 models are also available
   - Initial target models `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` and `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` are widely available

2. **API Structure**:
   - The Converse API provides a consistent interface across different model providers
   - Claude models on Bedrock support the full range of features including system prompts and tools
   - Token limits and other model parameters match direct Anthropic API access

3. **Authentication Options**:
   - Like Azure, Bedrock supports multiple authentication methods
   - The AWS credential provider chain works well for automatic credential discovery
   - No need for additional credentials beyond what's already available

## Next Steps

With the environment setup complete, we can now move on to:

1. **Core Provider Implementation (Phase 2)**:
   - Create the `Provider.BEDROCK` enum in provider_types.py
   - Implement BedrockSettings class in config.py
   - Create the BedrockAugmentedLLM class for the core provider implementation

2. **Initial Implementation Focus**:
   - Focus on Claude models initially as they have the most consistent API and feature support
   - Implement the Converse API as the primary interface for all models
   - Support AWS credential provider chain as the default authentication method

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - Use the created test scripts to verify the implementation
   - Start with basic text generation tests
   - Progress to multimodal and tool support tests

The test environment is fully set up and ready for implementation work to begin. The existing credentials have been confirmed to work correctly, and no additional credential setup is needed.
