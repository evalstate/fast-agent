## fast-agent contributor notes

- Use `uv run` for repo scripts and examples.
- Always run `uv run scripts/lint.py` and `uv run scripts/typecheck.py` after code changes.
- Keep examples under `examples/` in sync with packaged resources when relevant.
- Prefer small, focused diffs; avoid reformatting unrelated code.
- Use Markdown links for images and other content (example: `![Image](https://link.to.image)`).
